The smart door lock uses artificial intelligence to authenticate opening and closing the door
instead of the legacy key system. The smart door lock is attached to any door and makes it smart
without the requirement of any infrastructure. It uses facial recognition to authenticate a person
to enter the home. The model is simple and uses less components for facial recognition. Initially,
the system is trained with as many pre-saved images of the owner as possible but would still
require owner’s approval for opening the door. The efficiency of the modal will increase with
time as it will keep track of who enters the house. When the accuracy reaches a required
threshold, the door can operate without the user's intervention. If the smart door is open, it closes
through voice recognition and opens from the inside only through voice recognition also.
